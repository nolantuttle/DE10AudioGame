# DE10AudioGame
This project is an audio-based memory game running on the DE10 Standard embedded board. It has four buttons for four unique audio samples and generates a sequence of these audio samples to play from the audio codec on the board. The goal of the player is to press buttons which are mapped to audio samples to match the same sequence generated
